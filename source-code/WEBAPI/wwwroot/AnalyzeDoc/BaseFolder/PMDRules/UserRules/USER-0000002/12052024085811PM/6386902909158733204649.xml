    <externals name="Session Sidejacking" id="Capec_102" description="Session sidejacking takes advantage of an unencrypted communication channel between a victim and target system. The attacker sniffs traffic on a network looking for session tokens in unencrypted traffic. Once a session token is captured, the attacker performs malicious actions by using the stolen token with the targeted application to impersonate the victim. This attack is a specific method of session hijacking, which is exploiting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to a target system or information. Other methods to perform a session hijacking are session fixation, cross-site scripting, or compromising a user or server machine and stealing the session token.&#xA;" source="Capec" link="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/102.html" sourceID="Capec" ThreatType="Capec" />
